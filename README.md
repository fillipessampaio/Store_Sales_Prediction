## 1. Business objectives

<p> Store managers are tasked with predicting their daily sales for up to six weeks in advance. </p>

## 2. Assess situation

<p> Store sales are influenced by many factors, including promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality. With thousands of individual managers predicting sales based on their unique circumstances, the accuracy of results can be quite varied. </p>

## 3. Project goals

<p> This project intends to build a regression model to predict daily sales up to 6 weeks ahead using machine learning algorithms. </p>

## 4. Solution 

<p> At the end, a machine learning model based on XGBoost Regressor was built with a mean absolute percentage error of 12%.
<p> In the specific case, it was possible to forecast sales in the amount of $ 287,299,544.00 with a margin of error to $ 286,262,244.44 (worst scenario) and $ 288,196,758.92 (best scenario).
